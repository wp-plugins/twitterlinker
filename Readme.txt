It automagically linkifies @name in the text.

== Description ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1.How does it work? Magic!
2.What features do you plan to add? I plan to make it work in comments and in archives as well.  I may change it so it actually linkifies as it adds the content to the database, to reduce load on the browser as it renders the page.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
